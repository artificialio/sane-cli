# SANE Stack

##Overview
A **work in progress** that is meant to supersede the current [SANE Stack](https://github.com/artificialio/sane/) by building a cli layer on top of the existing [Sails](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails) and [Ember](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli) CLIs that will make working on this full stack a breeze. On top it will add an ecosystem, to add and setup things like authentication, foundation-sass, etc automatically so you can just focus on rapid, production-ready development.

We are planning to use [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) to simplify setup and make development more consistent.

##Contribution
Everyone is more than welcome to contribute in any way: Report a bug, request a feature or submit a pull request. Just keep things sensible, so we can easily reproduce bugs, have a clear explanation of your feature request, etc.
